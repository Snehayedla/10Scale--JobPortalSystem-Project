# 🧑‍💼 Mini Job Portal System (Java Console Application)

## 📌 Project Overview
The Mini Job Portal System is a console-based Java application developed using Core Java, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, and the Java Collections Framework.  
It simulates a simple job portal where Admins, Companies, and Candidates interact through a menu-driven interface.

This project is implemented strictly according to the assignment guidelines, without using any frameworks or databases.
